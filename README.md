# ðŸ‘· Cloudflare worker for FingerprintJS PRO agent
FingerprintJS Inc offers a Cloudflare Integration for the customers. The integration makes use of Cloudflare Workers, 
and this repository contains the source code of the worker. For more information about Cloudflare Workers, 
please read [here](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

The aim of this project is proxying FingerprintJS Inc services using the same origin as the website.

The worker code essentially does the followings:
- Serves the latest JS Pro Agent
- Acts as a proxy for the identification HTTP request, converts cookies into 1st party cookies in the process

You can find the full documentation [here](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/cloudflare-integration).
